      With over 3 years of work experience altogether with an internship, i have
      worked on multiple projects which include SaaS and PropTech. Throughout
      the course of my work, i have worked also gained experience in multiple
      tools & technologies. This hands-on experience has not only sharpened my
      technical skills but also instilled in me a versatile approach to
      problem-solving and a keen understanding of industry trends and best
      practices.Moreover, I have actively participated in requirement gathering
      sessions, collaborating closely with stakeholders to understand their
      needs, objectives, and pain points. By leveraging effective communication
      and active listening skills, I ensured that project requirements were
      accurately captured and translated into actionable development
      plans.Additionally, my role involved regular client interactions, where I
      served as a primary point of contact, providing updates on project
      progress, addressing concerns, and soliciting feedback to ensure alignment
      with client expectations. These experiences have honed my ability to
      effectively navigate client relationships and deliver solutions that meet
      or exceed their expectations. When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually go
      for a walk, run or I'll be at gym working out
